        <h3>Web-Development</h3>
        <p>I really enjoy designing websites and choosing styles I want to make the contents as appealing in different styles
        as possible. Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I have created a few informational websites and web-apps just for fun and to learn.
        Currently, I'm working on a few JS games built using the p5.js library, which will be hosted on a new website free to play!</p>

        <h3>Computer Programming</h3>
        <p>After taking APCS in high school, I began to use Java to develop some useful programs. It's a tough language, but it's also
          really organized. I hope to use Java to work on Backend Development in the future. I'm also learning Python on my own, I want to use
          the flexibility of Python to create some web games to start, and slowly begin web scraping and diving into Machine Learning and Data Analysis. </p>

        <h3>Guitar</h3>
        <p>Started Playing guitar in my sophomore year after I received an acoustic guitar as a gift, I took some classes but mostly
        continued to play on my own, learning different finger-styles and songs to play along with. It has been one of my favorite pasttime
        thing to do to cool down and enjoy the melody alone.</p>

        <h3>Photography</h3>
        <p>I like taking photos of nature and spontaneous scenes. Started using just an iPhone 6S, I tried to capture as many pictures that fit
        within my rectangular camera frame and my taste. Time is fleeting, but cameras can capture that ephemeral moment when the light breaks the<thead>
        dawn over the horizon; it can capture the stars shining away curiously in the distance; it can capture the moment when someone smiles and you wanted to keep that.
